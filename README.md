# Tablezap Churn Prediction


Overview
Welcome to the Tablezap Churn Prediction repository! This project aims to develop a churn prediction model for "Tablezap," a fictional restaurant reservation app. The repository contains the source code, data, and documentation related to building and evaluating the churn prediction model. The goal of this project is to help Tablezap identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling them to take proactive actions to retain them.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Prepare and clean the data for building the churn prediction model.

Feature Engineering: Identify and engineer relevant features for model development.

Model Training: Implement machine learning algorithms to train the churn prediction model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

Churn Prediction: Predict which customers are likely to churn and generate actionable insights.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the Tablezap Churn Prediction project, you'll need the following:

Python: Install Python on your machine.

Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis code.

Pandas: Install Pandas for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn: Install Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.

Matplotlib: Install Matplotlib for data visualization.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tablezap-churn-prediction.git
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the repository's root folder.

Open the "tablezap_churn_prediction.ipynb" notebook to access the model development code.

Run the cells in the notebook to perform the churn prediction analysis.

Usage
The Tablezap Churn Prediction project is conducted through the Jupyter Notebook. Follow these steps to perform the analysis:

Load the data: Ensure the Tablezap churn dataset (CSV file) is present in the "data" folder.

Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

Feature engineering: Engineer relevant features from the data to feed into the churn prediction model.

Model training: Implement machine learning algorithms to train the churn prediction model.

Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

Churn prediction: Use the trained model to predict which customers are likely to churn.

Data Source
The Tablezap Churn Prediction project uses a sample churn dataset included in the repository, located in the "data" folder. The sample data is for demonstration purposes only and does not represent real data from Tablezap.

Model Development
Data Preprocessing
Execute the data preprocessing steps in the "tablezap_churn_prediction.ipynb" notebook to clean and preprocess the data.

Feature Engineering
Implement feature engineering techniques in the same notebook to prepare relevant features for model development.

Model Training
Use machine learning algorithms in the notebook to train the churn prediction model.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques in the same notebook.
